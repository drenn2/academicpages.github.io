Hello, I am Jason Renn.* This is my academic website, where you can find details about my research, teaching, and other projects.   

If you are a current student at the [University of Denver](https://www.du.edu/index.html), then you'll probably want to go to the course [canvas website](https://canvas.du.edu/login/ldap) for announcements and other course materials. If you have questions, you can message me there, via email, or drop in during office hours.   

---------------------


<small>\* You'll also find me online as "Duu Renn" in publications and other official listings as that is my legal name. Yes, that's confusing for me too. No one calls me "Duu," not even my parents who gave me the name in the first place. Please just call me Jason or if you're a student, Professor Renn." </small>
