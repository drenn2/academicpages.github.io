> "You cannot just give someone a creativity injection. You have to create an environment for curiosity and a way to encourage people and get the best out of them." - Ken Robinson

## Philosophy
The purpose of higher education is to prepare students to solve problems and make informed decisions. My courses provide students with an opportunity to learn how to do this in the context of political questions by teaching them the tools of social science. As an educator, I strive to help students learn to use these tools in the classroom so that they are also able to apply their training outside of the course. Students should also be engaged with the subject matter and seek more information about international relations outside of class. Ultimately this training will help students exercise critical thinking in a broad range of careers and encourage informed civic engagement.

## Evaluations

> “Jason was a super relatable and straightforward professor. I loved most of the conversation activities that posed hypothetical situations or made other people form their opinions.” (_Causes of Civil War_, Spring 2015)  

> “You are the bomb.com. You honestly are the kindest and most helpful instructor I have ever had. RStudio techniques will be beneficial for my future goals.” (_Research Methods and Data Science_, Spring 2016)  

Student evaluations are a great opportunity to gauge effectiveness and adjust course content. They can also be really fun reading. I've included a few of these fun quotes above and links to my course evaluations for several recent solo-taught courses at the University of Illinois.

## Data Science Internships at the Cline Center for Democracy
I am currently working with the Cline Center for Democracy (located in Urbana, Illinois) to offer an internship for students in the Korbel School for International Studies. If selected, you will work with the Center during Summer 2018 on a research project and produce a paper by the end of the internship. This will be a great opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary team or researchers and use "big data" for a policy-oriented project. Look for updates here and at the career center.
