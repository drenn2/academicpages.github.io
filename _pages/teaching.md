## Evaluations
Student evaluations are a great opportunity to gauge effectiveness and adjust course content. They can also be really fun reading. I've included a few of these fun quotes below and links to my course evaluations for several recent solo-taught courses.  

> “Jason was a super relatable and straightforward professor. I loved most of the conversation activities that posed hypothetical situations or made other people form their opinions.” (_Causes of Civil War_, Spring 2015)  

> “Jason, you are the bomb.com. You honestly are the kindest and helpful instructor I have ever had. RStudio techniques will be beneficial for my future goals.” (_Research Methods and Data Science_, Spring 2016)

## Data Science Internships at the Cline Center for Democracy
I am currently working with the Cline Center for Democracy (located in Urbana, Illinois) to offer an internship for students in the Korbel School for International Studies. If selected, you will work with the Center during Summer 2018 on a research project and produce a paper by the end of the internship. This will be a great opportunity to work with an interdisciplinary team or researchers and use "big data" for a policy-oriented project. Look for updates here and at the career center.
