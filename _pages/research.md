My core research program focuses on the conflict studies, with specific interest in the consequences of civil war and post-war democratization. This research agenda fits into both International Relations and Comparative Politics as civil war studies typically straddle the line between these subfields. The overarching theme in both my main body of research and my other projects is how actors deal with the consequences of civil conflict. How do rebel groups reintegrate into society after a war? Why do some third parties have a greater effect on post-war stability than others? This research connects with some of my other research interests, including international conflict, international organizations, peacekeeping, conflict management, and democratization studies.

## Dissertation
What happens after a civil war? My dissertation project, _What's the Point of Post-Civil War Elections_  refines the question by first looking at the post-civil war political process, with particular attention paid to rebel groups and their political parties. While nearly ubiquitous in terms of occurrence, post-war elections are often neither free nor fair and a key distinction is whether rebel groups participate. Using my own original dataset on post-war elections and the new Group Electoral Participation (MGEP) published by Alia Matanock, I show that participation in these post-war elections is typically quite limited. Competition is fairly one-sided, with most rebel groups failing to stand in elections and election results tend to overwhelmingly favor incumbent governments. While some have suggested that limiting rebel group participation is necessary for stability, I also show that instability -- in the form of government repression -- is no worse when rebel groups do participate, suggesting that more inclusive elections are not as risky of a goal in post-conflict reconstruction.  

## Current Projects
### _The Politics of Post-War Elections_  
A part of my dissertation project, this article describes patterns in post-civil war elections and introduces the data that I collected on rebel group political parties and post-war election outcomes. (findings)  

### _Repression in the Aftermath of Post-War Elections_  
A tradeoff between stability and inclusion?  

### _Human Rights Practices and Treaty Membership_ (with [Xinyuan Dai](https://pol.illinois.edu/directory/profile/xdai))  

How do the terms of a treaty affect a country's deicison to join? We examine patterns in membership across all states in human rights treaties, specifically the Convention Against Torture (CAT) and the International Covenant on Cultural and Political Rights (ICCPR) using Dai's Multilateral Agreements and Protocols (MAP) Dataset. While poor domestic practice in terms of human rights does not deter states from joining these treaties, it does make states less likely to join their substantive protocols, demonstrating a concern over treaty design not previously found in the literature. 

### _The Law of Nations_  
How does international law affect interstate conflict? Past analyses of this question focus on membership in international organizations, but this paper uses membership in international treaties as a more precise measure of a state's commitment to the "law of nations." We see that membership in certain types of treaties corresponds with a lower incidence of Militarized Interstate Dispute (MID) activity. In contrast to findings in the Democratic Peace, this pacific effect exists on the monadic level as well as the dyadic. I am currently redoing the analysis with the heavily revised MID dataset released by Gibler et al (2017).  

### _Aid and Conflict_ (with [Bryce Reeder](https://politicalscience.missouri.edu/people/reeder), [David Bowden](https://www.sas.upenn.edu/irp/people/david-f-bowden), and Gina Martinez)  

Foreign aid is often tasked with helping develop areas that suffer from civil conflict, but aid organizations are sometimes the targets of violence in these contexts. How do violence events affect the decision of aid organizations to continue, move, or stop their projects. Using a geospatial approach, we describe the location of aid following acts of violence. The results speak to two important areas of research: the effectiveness of aid and security of aid workers.
